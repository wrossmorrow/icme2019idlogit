These are notebooks used to generate the results used in my [2019 Stanford ICME talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NAkj0c1H5kCUv64mC1v8n3oH56OmHViUlNSkSSnIe-k) on `idLogit`. They are highly redundant, and well worth better organization as a whole. Also, some of the experimental work can be somewhat intensive, so _caveat emptor_.
